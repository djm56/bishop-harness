# SOURCED ONLY — this file is never executed directly. It exports a single
# function to be called after sourcing.
#
# Shared POSIX sh function to parse .claude/bishop-memory.conf
#
# Usage:
#   . /path/to/.claude/lib/bishop-memory-conf.sh
#   bishop_memory_read_conf /path/to/.claude/bishop-memory.conf
#   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
#     echo "Mode: $BISHOP_MEMORY_MODE"
#   fi
#
# On success, returns 0 and sets these output variables:
#   BISHOP_MEMORY_MODE
#   BISHOP_MEMORY_URL
#   BISHOP_HARNESS
#   BISHOP_MEMORY_HOME
#
# On failure (file missing or unreadable), returns 1 and variables remain unchanged.
#
# NOTE: This function uses POSIX sh, which has no local keyword. The following
# variables persist in the caller's shell after the function returns:
#   _CONF_PATH
#   _CONFIG_LINE
#   _CONFIG_KEY
#   _CONFIG_VALUE
# Callers must avoid reusing these names; the underscore prefix marks them reserved.
#
# Parsing rules:
#   - Read line by line with IFS= read -r (no backslash interpretation)
#   - Skip blank lines and lines starting with #
#   - Split on the FIRST = only
#   - No whitespace trimming of key or value
#   - No quote stripping
#   - No inline trailing-comment stripping
#   - Unrecognized keys ignored
#   - Last occurrence of a repeated key wins
#
# Known limitation (same as pre-refactor):
#   A final line without a trailing newline is skipped by read and not processed.
#   Always ensure conf files end with a newline. This behavior matches the
#   original inline implementation and is retained to preserve the grammar.
